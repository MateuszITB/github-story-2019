<h1>Spring In Poland</h1>
<p>
    This year's late spring has probably appeared in Poland for good. Conditional word "probably" - not accidental.
    Only a few days ago we had ground frosts in the Suwałki region and Podlasie from minus 2 to minus 4 degrees C.
    Meteorological data from previous years, that we have been very cold and rainy, but also hot as summer.
    However, nowadays, after what we see around, it's safe to say that spring really came to Poland.
    Her heralds are animals; some have woken up from a long winter sleep, others have come and come from warm countries.

<p>
    Weather in the mountains and "sea of ​​crocuses"
    Share your knowledge about the weather in two parts - the south with warm, and air and northern, with cooler weather.
    The weather also favors the awakening nature, which is best seen on the Tatra mountains and in the mountain valleys.
    On the sunlit halls, in Kalatówki and in the Chochołowska Valley, the snow is almost gone,
    in its place the "sea of ​​crocuses" has spread.
</p>

<p>
    Tourists have something to admire, take a long weekend in the Tatrach and photograph,
    but - as warned by the TOPR service - we should remember that there is still a thick layer of snow or
    treacherous ice on the trails. "The snow cover is generally well-tied and stable." It is also possible
    to free the law, especially in a few places in very steep, extreme terrain.
