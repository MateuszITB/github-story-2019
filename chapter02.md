<h1>Spring In Poland</h1>
<p>
	Meanwhile, in the flat area of ​​the south, or indeed of Poland, we welcome spring in all its glory.
	They beautifully herald the spring season with green lawns, buds and leaves of trees and the first
	flowers in orchards, parks, gardens and meadows. And of course, the arrivals of the first birds
	from distant warm countries - from the south of Europe, Africa and Indochina, where they stayed during our winter.
</p>
<p>
	Heralds of spring in the frames of cameras.
	Birds heralding green and colored flowers in spring, we can now observe especially in the southern
	part of the country, and only for a dozen or so days, because usually the largest arrivals of birds,
	fall at the end of March and the beginning of April. But this year's longer winter delayed returns
	to the area of ​​all winged friends.
</p>

<p>
	Now, lovers of birds and animals in general, as well as photography enthusiasts, have a good time
	to watch the nature awakening from winter sleep. In the foothill and mountain regions as well as
	on the Biebrza River, you can find many priceless opportunities to be captured on film frames and
	scenes, dream pictures of badgers, rats, otters, beavers, bears, cranes, storks, geese and larks.
</p>
<p>
	It is worth in May heralding the beginning of a new life that wakes up after the winter,
	devote some time to observing the living nature, which in the later months will be quite different.
	And it is not only about the mentioned birds or quadrupeds, but also about many other species of animals,
	plants and insects. All together create a unique color of the origins of life that grows around us in spring.
