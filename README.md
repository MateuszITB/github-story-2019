## Forza (series)

## Overview
Forza (In Italian means "power") is a series of semi-sim racing video games for Xbox consoles and Microsoft Windows published by Xbox Game Studios. The franchise is currently divided into two series; the original Forza Motorsport series developed by American developer Turn 10 Studios, which focuses on primarily professional-style track racing events and series, and the open world-styled Forza Horizon series mainly developed by British developer Playground Games, which revolves around a fictitious "annual" music and racing festival called the "Horizon Festival" that is held in fictional representations of real world areas. Each main instalment of both series have so far been released on a biennial basis, with Motorsport entries releasing in odd-numbered years and Horizon entries releasing in even-numbered years.
